# BasicOpenGLModules

This is a small libary with diffrent modules for building games and other media application using OpenGL.

All libarys in the libary folder are 64Bit if you want to use the Basic-OpenGL-Modules you have to replace them with the 32 Bit ones.
The following libarys will be found in the libary folder.

* SDL2 for OpenGL initalisation and inputhandling
* SDL_mixer for sounds
* SDL_image for advanced texture formats like png.
* glm for the advanced support.

The libary also provides base classes for the 
[Entity-Component Pattern](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html)

## So far covert:
* OpenGL Window
* VBO Renderer
* PLY Parser ( PLY format can be exported by blender)
* Shaders
* Png Loading

## In Progress

* Lightning
* Partikel
* Highmap Terrain generation
